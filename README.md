### Private Chat Application

## Problem Statement:

Over time, as companies in the world face many issues in terms of their own privacy and data while sharing confidential information among the empoyees of the companies. For example, if company A has some information regarding the latest upcoming project and want to share it with their employees there is always a chance of data leakage if commercial applications like whatsapp, etc are used. In every company the subject of data confidentiality is very important and most of the time it comes above every other parameters. A private messaging Application is very helpful for this problem.

## Proposed Solution

This project proposes the solution as a "Chatting application in Kotlin". This project is designed in a way where all the employees in the company can send messages regarding all the confidential data of anything without any fear of data leakage.

Once the app is finished the testing part, I plan to communicate with various companies regarding the app idea and add more features such as image and video sharing in the app.
